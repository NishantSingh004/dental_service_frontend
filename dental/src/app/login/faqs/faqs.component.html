                  >How should we handle patient privacy and
                  confidentiality?</strong

                <p>
                  All patient information must be kept confidential. Use secure
                  systems for storing and sharing patient records, and never
                  discuss patient information outside the clinic.
                </p>

                  emergencies?</strong
                >
                <p>
                  In the event of a medical emergency, immediately notify the
                  dentist or healthcare provider on duty. Follow the clinicâ€™s
                  emergency protocol for treatment and notify relevant
                  authorities if needed.
